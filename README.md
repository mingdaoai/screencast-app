## AI Prompt
This project was created using Cursor, an AI code editor. The initial prompt for AI was:

- I want to create a screen and camera recorder that allows me to record my screen and camera simultaneously. 
- I want to be able to download the recorded videos separately after stopping the recording.
- The UI should contain 3 buttons to start recording screen, camera and both.
- After stopping the recording, a download button should show up. It can download the appropriate video based on the recording type, and download both if the recording type is both.
- There should be a video element to show the recording screen.
